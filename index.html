        <p>
        Hey, I just heard about Github Pages and I want to give it a try.<br>
        Even though I only know some basic HTML and CSS.. teehee :p.<br>
        My favorite colors are black and blue.<br>
        You'll find it wonderful if combine them altogether. That's why I made this simple website black for the background. I just don't like white, it's too shiny in my dark life.<br>
        Hahahh..<br>
        If God still give me life, I want to learn more deeper about this, HTML, CSS, JS, and more about Web Development...<br>
